# Overview

### This is a Node.js TypeScript application using Express and WebSocket.

- Data Caching: Upon starting the server, it makes an API call to fetch data and caches this data for 1 minute. A timer is then set to refresh this data every 60 seconds.

- WebSocket Integration: When a client connects via WebSocket, the server sends the current cached data along with the remaining time until the next update. This allows the client to display the data to the user and also set up a timer based on the remaining time.

- Client Communication: The server communicates the cached data and remaining time to the client upon connection. The client uses this information to display data and manage timers.

- Customization: The interval for data updates and the caching duration can be adjusted according to business requirements and team needs.
